This is a standalone program to show the ftx rules dialog for editing the
ftx_rules table in the database: the same dialog that you get when you press
the RULES button in the sbitx GUI.  It was useful for testing during
development, and it might be useful if you don't want to run the whole sbitx
program for some reason, or are running a "daemon" version of it.
