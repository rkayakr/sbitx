# v5.3 - Currently In Test/Dev
**New Features:**
- Refactored multiple UI elements (Mode, Band, BandStack, Span, Menu, and more!) to use Dropdowns which should allow for better access when using the touch screen. (Jared KJ5DTK)
- CW decoding while sending (Jared KJ5DTK)
- "Quick Options" menu by holding both encoder buttons for 2 seconds. (Jared KJ5DTK)
- `\cal` command for calibrating the scale per band (external Power/SWR meter required). (Jared KJ5DTK)
- `\snap` command to take screen shot of sBitx software
- Voltage and Current added to UI by VFO (Jared KJ5DTK)
- Power and SWR shown with a decimal place (Jared KJ5DTK)
- Added High SWR trigger and auto power reduction to 1 which is configurable by the \maxvswr command, default to 3:1
- ADIF UDP Logging Support (Jared KJ5DTK).  
  + Configured via user_settings.ini: 
    ```
    #adif_broadcast_enable=OFF
    #adif_broadcast_ip=127.0.0.1
    #adif_broadcast_port=2237
    ```
  + Can be used to log to a local or remote logbook.  Or to FT8battle.com 
- **FTx features** (Shawn K7IHZ / LB2JK):
  + Updated to latest ft8_lib. It now labels spans in the message text so we get them identified correctly.
  + Support for non-standard calls (special stations, prefixes used while travelling, etc.)
  + Support for CQ tokens (such as CQ POTA or CQ 123)
  + Transmit pitch can be changed between transmitted messages
  + Incoming/outgoing messages are logged to the terminal
  + Send RR73 in response to an R-report instead of RRR
  + Look up callsign country names in a local copy of cty.dat (automatically updated)
  + **FT4** support: same features as FT8, twice as fast (and less robust)
  + More timestamp precision for both FT4 and FT8
  + FTX_CQ ALT_EVEN setting: CQ every 4th slot (listen more)
  + FTX_AUTO modes:
    * OFF is fully manual: click messages only to populate logger fields, then use macro buttons
    * ANS auto-answers and finishes QSOs; click a previous incoming message if you need to repond again to it
    * CQRESP additionally chooses a CQ to respond to, when no QSO is in progress
    * ftx_rules table in the database holds rules to prioritize which message to answer
    * there's a "rules" window for editing those
  + colors:
    * different colors on different fields; interesting stuff stands out
    * my callsign: red
    * callsigns and grids found in recent QSOs from the logbook: dim green to avoid standing out
    * otherwise, a caller that has not had a recent QSO with me is orange, and a grid is amber
    * new setting `recent_qso_age`, in hours (24 by default)
- **xOTA** for activators (Shawn K7IHZ / LB2JK):
  + Before your activation, choose IOTA/SOTA/POTA in settings, and add the island/peak/park location reference
  + Choose IOTA/SOTA/POTA macros to get a special CQ button
  + Choose FTX_CQ XOTA to send alternating "CQ SOTA" (POTA/IOTA) and "SO &lt;location&gt;" (PO/IO) to tell chasers where you are
  + xota and location are logged to the database, and can be exported to ADIF, ready for upload afterwards
- **Logbook** (Shawn K7IHZ / LB2JK):
  + the Freq field is Hz-accurate in FTx modes (dial frequency + pitch)
  + Editing comments afterwards from the logbook window works better
  + Power and SWR are logged to the database
  + ADIF export includes TX_PWR
- **Remote-X11 features** (e.g. via ssh forwarding from your Linux desktop):
  + Clicking a message (in addition to responding if it's FT8/FT4) copies the text to the X11 selection
    so that you can paste it anywhere with the middle mouse button
  + Any field can be adjusted with the mouse wheel while hovering: no need to click first

# v5.2
**New Features:**
- **RIT tuning** fully implemented (by Jon W2JON) with excellent spectrum visualization of RX/TX offset relationship.
- **Paddle reverse** for left-handed operators: `cwreverse on/off`.
- **Audio Peaking Filter (APF)** added (CW mode only). Boosts weak signals with Gaussian curve, no sharp skirts.
  Command: `apf <gain> <width>` (e.g., `apf 6 100`); `apf` alone = off.
- Fullscreen mode for the radio GUI

**CW Keyer Overhaul:**
- Complete keyer code cleanup and refactoring. Iambic modes aligned with real-world expectations (big thanks to Chris W0ANM).
- New keyboard CW behavior: text typed into buffer is **not sent** until **Enter** is pressed. Allows editing and mixing with macros before transmission.
- **Macro stacking** now supported: multiple macros + keyboard input can be queued and sent sequentially. Tip: add leading/trailing spaces to macros to prevent words running together.
- Fixed long-standing bug: macros now trigger even when text entry field has focus.

**CW Envelope & Shaping:**
- TX keying envelope upgraded to **Blackman-Harris** (previously raised-cosine → table-driven). Expected to be cleaner; spectrum analyzer verification pending.

**CW Decoder Improvements:**
- Added pre-downsampling low-pass filter to reduce aliasing and improve SNR.
- Goertzel detector now precisely centers on CW pitch with additional ±35 Hz side detectors for off-frequency signals.
- Extensive tweaking of all decoder stages. Subjective decoding performance significantly better (objective tests still difficult).

**UI/UX Fixes & Enhancements:**
- Multi-function knob auto-reverts to volume control after 15 seconds of inactivity (or instant push-to-toggle).
- Fixed RX/TX EQ frequency controls and filter-width/pitch interaction bug.
- Improved VFO/spectrum alignment.
- Smoothed VFO tuning code: eliminated jumps.
  - `\TA ON` still enables acceleration.
  - TAT1/TAT2 commands removed.
  - Slow → normal rate; moderate → 5× rate; very fast → higher rate (temporary, auto-resets).

**Morse Tables:**
- Further corrections and improvements to TX keyboard tables and RX decoder tables.

**Built-in FT8 Updates** (by Fabrizio F4VUK):
- Auto-mode now tracks calls already worked in current session.
- Old QSO data cleared when calling CQ.
